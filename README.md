## Maribelle Garden Set
 A website project created to showcase what I have learnt so far from course modules.
 This dynamic website is composed of two pages , the Home page and the Cart/basket page.

 ### Home Page 
 In the home page , I have implemented some bootstrap , HTML , CSS and small bit of Javascript in order to
 make the page more interactive and user friendly. Bootstrap icons made it the web page more engaging.
 I have showcase the products in the home page. I use CSS to design the box/grid where  I placed the items or product.
 I used some Javascript code in order to add items to the cart. The footer in the web page is simply done with HTML code.

 ### Cart Page
 This page is created with some CSS to style the grid and some Bootstrap icons to make it more intersting.
 Also some Javescript to let the user delete some items they don't want in their basket.
